1. The Finnish 1933/1938 Bible translation, is in the public domain but not yet available as a digital 100% exact copy. 
   * The currently released digital text has been synthesised and edited from multiple digital sources in the 1990's by the HELFI project.  The result is unique to this work and subject to corrections (quotation marks etc.) in the future versions of the HELFI corpus.  
   * Each HELFI version of the digital edition of the public domaiin text is licenced under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) by its creator.  This does not restrict the publication, but the added value of the checksums is to track the versions and help to convergence of digital editions to the physical manuscript of the translation.

1. The Finnish morphology and lemmatisation have been made available for noncommercial, academic use by the collaboration agreement between the University of Helsinki that held Lingsoft's License to use FINTWOL analyser in academic projects and the RV Publishing House (later Aika[media]) carrying out manual disambiguation and editing for the Finnish Analytical Bible Concordance Project of later Aika[media] Oy.  

   Further processing of the Finnish morphology have been made by Anssi Yli-Jyrä in 2020 for the HELFI corpus.  The changes involve disambiguation rules for verb inflections, the interpretation of gloss extractors at the alignment links, simplification of the analyses, dropping the Aikamedia copyrighted NER and coreference annotation, and harmonising the morphological glosses with the de facto standard glossing abbreviations and the Leipzig glossing rules (but without introducing morpheme boundaries to the synthetic Finnish word forms).  These changes to the ealier analyses are available for noncommercial, academic use.

1. The Leningrad Codex of the Hebrew Bible, the Tanakh, is in the public domain but particular digital versions of it are under copyright and restrictive licenses.  
   * We obtained a digital version of the Leningrad Codex through the [Open Scriptures Hebrew Bible project](https://hb.openscriptures.org/) that states that the text of the codex they are using (WLC) is in the public domain.  They provided a link to [Tanach.us](http://www.tanach.us/Tanach.xml) whose [License](https://tanach.us/License.html) states that **"All biblical Hebrew text, in any format, may be viewed or copied without restriction. Citation of this site as the source of the text is appreciated. Please include the version number, 25.5, as a reference."**  The same site presents the TEI Header of the "Unicode/XML Leningrad Codex Version WLC 4.20" that has been transcripted from the [Westminster Leningrad Codex, version 4.20] by Christopher V. Kimball under the permission of Kirk Lowery from the J. Alan Groves Center for Advanced Biblical Research stating that the result is **"Freely available"**.
   * This seems to be limited or even contradicted by the fact that the [Westminster Leningrad Codex WLC 4.20 (WLC)](http://www.tanach.us/Pages/TEIHeader.xml) is under the copyright of the J. Alan Groves Center for Advanced Biblical Research.
According to the locator information at (https://www.bible.com/fi/versions/904-wlc-hebrew-westminster-leningrad-codex) the WLC 4.20 is under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.  However, the site of [J. Alan Groves Center for Advanced Biblical Research](https://www.grovescenter.org/) writes that "the Westminster Leningrad Codex (WLC) and the Westminster Hebrew Morphology (WHM), and the Westminster Hebrew Syntax (WHS) databases **will be released soon** under a **Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No-Derivative License**."  

Our work has been based on the fact that the Leningrad Codex is in the public domain and the (Tanach.us) site distrubutes the digital text freely.  We are not changing its license or the text, but we have changed its file format from XML to column oriented.  This may be a problem and we continue investigating how to detect and address any remaining issues.  In worst case, this could mean that we must withdraw the column oriented texts and release only less usable stand-off XML annotations as a supplement to the OSHB.  Your help with solving the issues would be greatly appreciated.
