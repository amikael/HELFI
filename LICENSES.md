# Licenses

## Our alignment data

**The alignment data of the HELFI corpus consist exclusively of the alignment link numbers, the gloss extractors and the link qualifiers added to the Finnish 1933/1938 translation.  All the alignment data of the HELFI corpus are licenced under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). For attribution purposes, credit the Finnish Analytical Bible Concordance Project of Aika[media] Oy.**

The texts, lemma and morphology databases of the three languages in the corpus **are NOT covered by the above license**.  They are just made available as open third-party components but in our custom file formats.    These components are either in the public domain or under licenses that allow their use under specific restrictions.  The only exception is the base text of the Hebrew Bible whose availability seem to have contradictory interpretations until we have obtained an explicit permit. 

## Components That Remain in the Public Domain

1. **The Pyhä Raamattu Finnish Bible**.  The Finnish 1933/1938 Bible translation (Pyhä Raamattu) is in the public domain but not available as a digital 100% exact copy. 

   > You may copy and distribute the digital form of the Bible in the public domain. 

1. **The Leningrad Codex of the Hebrew Bible, the Tanakh.**  We obtained a digital version of the Leningrad Codex through the [Open Scriptures Hebrew Bible project](https://hb.openscriptures.org/) that states that the text remains in the public domain.  They provided a link to [Tanach.us](http://www.tanach.us/Tanach.xml) whose [License](https://tanach.us/License.html) states that **"All biblical Hebrew text, in any format, may be viewed or copied without restriction. Citation of this site as the source of the text is appreciated. Please include the version number, 25.5, as a reference."**  The same site presents the TEI Header of the "Unicode/XML Leningrad Codex Version WLC 4.20" that has been transcripted from the [Westminster Leningrad Codex, version 4.20] by Christopher V. Kimball under the permission of Kirk Lowery from the J. Alan Groves Center for Advanced Biblical Research stating that the result is **"Freely available"**.

   > Currently, we do not have a proof of integrity for the Hebrew Bible base text in the HELFI corpus.  You may use the Hebrew Bible alignment and its source text only at your own risk.  For more information on the integrity, See below on the Westminster Leningrad Codex.

1. **The Greek New Testament**.  Eberhard Nestle's (1904, 1913): _H Kainη ∆iaθηkη (Greek New Testament); Text with Critical Apparatus_. British and Foreign Bible Society.  The first edition of 1904, and a reprinting from 1913 are available throug the Internet Archive.  [The electronic version edited by Diego Renato dos Santos](https://sites.google.com/site/nestle1904/) is identified by http://sites.google.com/site/nestle1904/.

   > The body text of the Greek New Testament (GNT) in the HELFI corpus is in the **public domain**.

1. **The Open Scriptures Hebrew Bible**. 

   > The Strong's lemma and morphology data of the Hebrew Bible are licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). For attribution purposes, credit the Open Scriptures Hebrew Bible Project (https://hb.openscriptures.org/).

1. **The Greek Lemmas and Morphology**.  The lemmas and morphological parsing of the Nestle 1904 edition have been created by Dr. Ulrik Sandborg-Petersen of Emergence Consult and Aalborg University, Denmark, and released into the **public domain**. Available at https://github.com/biblicalhumanities/Nestle1904.

   > The lemmas and morphology of the GNT in the HELFI corpus are in the **public doman**.

## Third-Party Components That Remain under Their Current Licenses

1. **The Description of the Finnish Bible Digital Edition**.  The currently released digital text edition of the 1933/1938 Finnish Bible translation has been synthesised and edited from multiple digital sources in the 1990's by the HELFI project.  The result is unique to this work and subject to corrections (quotation marks etc.) in the future versions of the HELFI corpus.  By releasing the description of each digital edition, our purpose is to create a culture that maintains their version history.

   > The *description* of the digital text edition of the 1933/1938 Finnish Bible translation is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 International license https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/.  For attribution purposes, credit the Finnish Analytical Bible Concordance Project (c) 1997 and Anssi Yli-Jyrä (c) 12 March 2020.

1. **The Finnish Bible Lemmas and Morphology**.  The Finnish lemmas and morphology have been made available for noncommercial, academic use by the collaboration agreement between the University of Helsinki that held Lingsoft's License to use FINTWOL analyser in academic projects and the RV Publishing House (later Aika[media]) carrying out manual disambiguation and editing for the Finnish Analytical Bible Concordance Project of later Aika[media] Oy.  

   > If you need an explicit license to use the Finnish lemmas or morphology, please contact the sales in Aika[media] Oy, Keuruu. 

1. Further processing of the Finnish morphology have been made by Anssi Yli-Jyrä in 2020 for the HELFI corpus.  The changes involve disambiguation rules for verb inflections, the interpretation of gloss extractors at the alignment links, simplification of the analyses, dropping the Aikamedia copyrighted NER and coreference annotation, and harmonising the morphological glosses with the de facto standard glossing abbreviations and the Leipzig glossing rules (but without introducing morpheme boundaries to the synthetic Finnish word forms).  These changes to the ealier analyses are available for noncommercial, academic use.

   > If you need a reformatted or extended version fo the Finnish text, you should be in touch with Anssi Yli-Jyrä for technical support. 

1. **The Description of the Digital Edition of the Leningrad Codex**.  We obtained a digital version of the Leningrad Codex through the [Open Scriptures Hebrew Bible project](https://hb.openscriptures.org/) that actually claims to include the Westminster Leningrad Codex (WLC).(http://www.tanach.us/Pages/TEIHeader.xml) whose copyright belongs to the J. Alan Groves Center for Advanced Biblical Research.  The site of [J. Alan Groves Center for Advanced Biblical Research](https://www.grovescenter.org/) writes that "the Westminster Leningrad Codex (WLC) and the Westminster Hebrew Morphology (WHM), and the Westminster Hebrew Syntax (WHS) databases **will be released soon** under a **Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No-Derivative License**."  However, the locator information at (https://www.bible.com/fi/versions/904-wlc-hebrew-westminster-leningrad-codex) states that the WLC 4.20 is already under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.  

   We are now seeking, together with the J. Alan Groves Center, an explicit exception to the NoDerivatives clause to allow us to use our column oriented file format and add a specific token numbering.  Currently, the Hebrew Text in the HELFI corpus must be seen as a close derivative of a public domain text, having no official relationship and integrity with the WLC.  In other words, you are using it at your own risk.
