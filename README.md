# HELFI (Embargo 11 May 2020 or earlier; This repository is currently under construction.)
**HELFI: a Hebrew-Greek-Finnish Parallel Bible Corpus with Cross-Lingual Morpheme Alignment**:  An fine-grained and open morpheme-alignment between the most important 20th century Finnish Bible translation and the most relevant source texts.

## Parts of the HELFI Corpus

* [The Nestle 1904 Greek New Testament with Sandborg-Petersen's lemmas and morphology](https://github.com/amikael/HELFI/Greek) in a column-oriented file format containing token numbers for cross-lingual alignment
* [The Leningrad Codex Hebrew Bible (the Tanach) with the OSHB lemmas and morphology](https://github.com/amikael/HELFI/Hebrew) in a column-oriented file format containing token numbers for cross-lingual alignment

# To-Do

1. The remaining licensing issues with the Hebrew Bible base text should be resolved.

1. The morphological glosses of extractors (%inflection, %mod, etc.) should be reviewed and corrected where necessary.

1. The Hebrew text needs non-numerical Strong's lemmas or the lemmas used in the Finnish Analytical Bible Concordance.

1. The codes and the alignment guidelines in the corpus need to be documented.

1. The inter-annotation agreement on the alignment and morphological disambiguation should be estimated.
