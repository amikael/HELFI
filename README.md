## Changes Made to the Public Domain Resources

The Greek text included top the HELFI corpus aims to reflect the reading used by the 1938 Finnish translation of the Greek New Testament (GNT).  The Finnish Analytical Bible Concordance Project compared the Finnish translation to the Nestle-Aland 26th Edition (NA26), finding that the source edition was older.  The Finnish translation of the GNT was tentatively finished already in 1913 and must have followed largely the 1913 reprint of Eberhard Nestle's 1904 GNT edition (A.F.Puukko 1946: Suomalainen Raamattumme, Otava, page 403).  However, Erwin Nestle's 13th edition of the GNT was published in 1927 and we do not know exactly how the Bible Translation Committee finalized their translation in 1938.  Did they consult Erwin's GNT edition?   The HELFI Project, which was comparing the Finnish 1938 translation to the Nestle 1904 was able to track some of the text critical choices.   The Greek source text released now is, therefore, not the facsimile copy of the Nestle 1904 but rather the edition with some deviating readings.
