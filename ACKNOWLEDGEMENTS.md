The dataset was created between 1991-2020 in two phases.  The **Product Development** phase (the Finnish Analytical Bible Concordance Project 1991-1997) was funded by Aika[media] Oy.  The Finnish lemmatisation has been supported by Aikamedia's collaboration with [Lingsoft Oy](https://www.lingsoft.fi/) and Professor Kimmo Koskenniemi at the University of Helsinki (UH).  The members of the editorial board were:  
* **Executive Editor** [Valtter Luoto](https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valtter_Luoto) (the publication of Bible Encyclopedias, visionary goals, concept design, and funding negotiation at Aika Oy), 
* **Editor in Chief** Lic.Th. [Matti Liljeqvist](https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matti_Liljeqvist) (alignment of the Hebrew Bible, alignment validation, product concept finalisation, proof reading, source language lexicography)
* M.A. [Anssi Yli-Jyrä](https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/fi/persons/anssi-yli-jyr%C3%A4) (technical lead, methodological innovation, alignment guidelines, natural language processing, text curation, morphological analysis, multi-word analysis, alignment editor, headword design, concordancing) 
* M.Th. Kari M. Räntila (alignment guidelines, alignment of the Greek New Testament, lexicon sketch for Greek)
* M.Th. [Arto Antturi](https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arto_Antturi) (concept design, license negotiations, methodological innovation, alignment guidelines)
* B.A. [Pekka Nieminen](http://kaannostoimisto-pekka-nieminen.onverkossa.fi/) (disambiguationof morphology and lemmas, named entity recognition and classification, coreference annotation, headword design).

The Product Development phase build a proprietary database, the Scaffold Corpus, that is not released.  However, we acknowledge the importance of having the following proprietary resources available to the Concordance Project in 1992-1997 as proprietary but important parts of the Scaffold Corpus:
* [Westminster Hebrew Morphology (WHM) and Lemma Database v.1.0](https://www.grovescenter.org/projects/westminster-hebrew-morphology/).  The analysis in this database had been perfected by scholars under the direction of Professor Alan Groves in the Westminster Theological Seminary, but the draft morphological analysis was done with the parser developed by Richard Whitaker (Claremont, Prince- ton Seminary).
* Paul Miller’s Greek New Testament Database from [the GRAMCORD Institute](http://www.gramcord.org/).

The **Resource Sharing** phase (2017-2020) has been enabled by the CC-BY license of Aikamedia and been supported by the University of Helsinki Faculty of Arts (decision N2/2017 for mobility support and 2018-2019 decisions for research assistance).  The purpose of this phase was to replace the propriate components in the Scaffold Corpus with resources that had fewer restriction.  The members of this phase were 
* **Principal Investigator** Docent Ph.D. Anssi Yli-Jyrä (license negotiations, supervision, the corpus documentation, data curation)
* M.Th. Josi Purhonen (free resource selection, data curation, resource switchover and its documentation, UNICODE translation)
