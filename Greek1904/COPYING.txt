    The Greek New Testament with Lemma and Morphology Data

Eberhard Nestle's (1904, 1913): H Kainη ∆iaθηkη (Greek New Testament);
Text with Critical Apparatus was published by British and Foreign
Bible Society, but it is now the public domain.  The digital version
(https://sites.google.com/site/nestle1904/) was edited by Diego Renato
dos Santos and is in the public domain.

OBThe Finnish Analytical Bible Concordance Project (1991-1997) extended
the digitised Nestle 1904 with additional verses that had been
translated from a complementary source edition in 1938.  The added
verses are in the public domain.

   The GNT in the HELFI corpus is a proper extension of Nestle's 1904
   GNT.  The extended GNT is in the public domain.
   
The lemmas and morphological data of the Nestle 1904 edition have been
created by Professor Maurice A. Robinson at Southeastern Baptist
Theological Seminary, North Carolina, and Dr. Ulrik Sandborg-Petersen
at the Emergence Consult and the Aalborg University, Denmark.

   The lemmas and morphology of the GNT in the HELFI corpus are in the
   public doman.
