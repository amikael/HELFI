## The changes made to the public domain resources

### Changes to the Finnish 1933/1938 translation

Since 3,000 typographical mutations between the available printed and electronic copies of the translation were detected in 1996, the HELFI corpus contains the text curated by Anssi Yli-Jyr√§ in the Finnish Analytical Bible Concordance Project in 1996.  We are planning to review this work by consulting the physical master copy of the Finnish translation.   This is available at the National Archives of Finland, but no direct digital copies of the translation manuscript is known.    

### Changes to the files containing the Leningrad Codex of the Hebrew Bible

There are no content changes to the texts, but the XML file format of the OSHB has been replaced with a column-oriented format described in the HELFI paper.  This format contains HELFI-specific token numbers and fields and is helpful in communicating the way in which the texts have been aligned.

### Changes to the files containing the Nestle 1904 Edition of the Greek New Testament

There are no content changes to the texts, but the file format has been replaced with a column-oriented format described in the HELFI paper.  This format contains HELFI-specific token numbers and fields.
