          The Hebrew Bible with Lemma and Morphology Data

The Leningrad Codex of the Hebrew Bible is in the public domain. We
obtained a digital version of the Leningrad Codex through the Open
Scriptures Hebrew Bible project (https://hb.openscriptures.org/).  The
Hebrew Bible in the current distribution of the HELFI corpus contains
one unintended change (it will be fixed in the future).

   The Hebrew Bible of the HELFI corpus are in the public domain.
   You may use at your own risk.

   The Roman script transliteration of the Hebrew Bible has been
   developed in the spirit of the SBL transliteration standard, but
   does not yet capture the standard in every detail.  You may use the
   transliteration only at your own risk.

The lemmas and morphology data of the Leningrad Codex have been
created by the Open Scriptures Hebrew Bible Project
