**The texts, lemma and morphology databases of the three languages in the corpus are not covered by our license.**  They are just made available as open third-party components but in our custom file formats.    These components are either in the public domain or under licenses that allow their use under specifix restrictions.  The only exception is the base text of the Hebrew Bible whose availability seem to have two contradictory interpretations that we are able to solve.
