## The Free Alignment Data of the HELFI Corpus

The alignment data of the HELFI corpus consist exclusively of **the alignment link numbers**, **the gloss extractors** and **the link qualifiers** added to the Finnish 1933/1938 translation, and **source-side token numbers** added to the Hebrew and Greed source texts.  

> **The alignment data of the HELFI corpus are licenced under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). For attribution purposes, credit the Finnish Analytical Bible Concordance Project of Aika[media] Oy.**

The alignment excludes and data does not include the Hebrew, Greek and Finnish base texts, their lemmatisation and morphological analysis.  Therefore, **the texts, lemma and morphology databases of the three languages in the corpus are not covered by our current license.**  They are just made available as open third-party components (essentially available as downloads through other open efforts) but in our custom file formats.   

## The In-House Version of the Alignment Database

The in-house version of the alignment database was first included to a proprietary Scaffold Corpus inside the Finnish Analytical Bible Concordance Project of Aika[media] Oy.  After the Scaffold Corpus was ready, the publisher used it to produce the handbook in a few months:
